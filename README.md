# Library Management System - SQL Project

Welcome to the **Library Management System**! üìö This is a **MySQL-based** project designed to manage the complete lifecycle of library operations such as **book borrowing, member management, staff coordination, and fine handling**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world library system, where books are managed, borrowed, and returned by library members. The system tracks:
- **Books**: Title, author, genre, available copies, etc.
- **Members**: Personal details of library members.
- **Staff**: Library staff roles and information.
- **Transactions**: Borrow and return activities.
- **Fines**: Late return fines calculation.

This project implements several features such as:
- **Database design** with multiple tables and relationships.
- **Stored procedures** for managing book borrowing and returning.
- **Views** for easy reporting (e.g., borrowed books, fines).
- **Analytics**: Get insights like most borrowed books, members with late returns, etc.
